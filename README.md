# Overview

## Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.


One thing I'm trying to accomplish as a software engineer is to be able to make useful impact in the field of technology, being able to create web applicaton and or useful software that will make daily task easy for end users concern. In order to be able to accomplish this, learning specific languages for different task function is very much important in my career part. You cannot talk to a software engineer without asking about their programming, logical, and technical problem solving skills.

## Provide a description of the software that you wrote and how it integrates with a Cloud Database. Describe how to use your program.

For this project I continued to work on my group project with research on using the firebase database to create user login and sign up page for our group mobile/web app that we are working on. In doing so I created a login page using html framework and css. And as part of creating the database, javascript was used connecting the firebase project account to store user information and for authentication once a user sign up and later want to login. Javascript was the main focus for this project. Though encouter multiple failuire, but the experience overall was worth it. 

## Describe your purpose for writing this software.

For personal learning and to fulfill a group project for this class. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of the cloud database.}
